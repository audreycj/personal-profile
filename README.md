# personal-profile
This was a formative assessment for our IT103P (Web Programming) course during my 2nd year as a Computer Science student.
We were given the following instructions:

Using HTML & CSS, create a personal profile page. Must include:
- At least 1 photo of yourself (can add more)
- An autobiography (350 words minimum)
- Your hobbies, likes, and interests.
- Day in the life. (What you do in a normal day)

Add your HTML & CSS in a zip file and submit it.
