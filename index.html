                <h3 class="about__me">about me . . .</h3>
                <p>My name is <i>Audrey Carmel Jay J. Nanual</i>, and I was born on the 16th of July 2000 in Iligan City, Lanao del Norte, Philippines. I am known by several names, depending on what phase of my life people met me. Those who met me during childhood through Junior High School call me by my nickname, <i>“Adee”</i> or <i>“Ad.”</i> Those who met me during and after Senior High School call me <i>“Audrey”</i> or <i>“Auds.”</i> I live in the suburbs of Mati City, Davao Oriental, with my mother, a college professor at our state university, and my 13-year-old younger sister, a seventh-grader attending a local academy. I am currently attending Davao City’s Malayan Colleges Mindanao (A Mapúa School) via online classes to work on my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>Despite coming to the world in Northern Mindanao, I spent a big chunk of my life in the south. My earliest memories comprised of trips to our local beaches, spontaneous motorcycle night rides with my father (who is currently living in Maco, Davao de Oro), and countless adventures with the neighborhood kids under the unforgiving sun. After that unproblematic life phase, I proceeded to attend the preschool at the university my mother worked. I did not stay there very long, however, because of my shyness and a bully that I no longer remember. I then transferred to a local private academy where I spent my kindergarten, elementary, and junior high school days. After completing JHS, I was shipped to Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental in Southern Visayas—mainly so I would be near Siquijor to visit my maternal grandparents every now and then. I studied at Silliman University and stayed there until I <i>finally</i> and <i>officially</i> graduated high school.</p>
                <p>Cue in college. Until then, I remained a top student primarily because of my adaptability. I was what you would call a <i>Jack of all trades, master of none</i> kind of person, so I genuinely had no clue what program to take for college. I had no strong passion or interest in anything; I only did things out of boredom, curiosity, peer pressure, and duty. I was briefly intrigued by the medical field because of the countless k-dramas I have watched, but I eventually dropped it. (I concluded that the money and time I would have to invest is not worth it.) With that, I basically went <i>YOLO</i> and went with my mom's long-time suggestion to give the IT industry a try. </p>
                <p>Now, I am in my 2nd year as a Computer Science student. I am still a little behind in terms of knowledge and skills related to my program, and I am still incredibly frustrated about my relatively slow progress, but I want to commit to this until the end. I have met many wonderful people in MCM that have been a great help in my development as a person and a future professional. I look forward to more things to learn, more skills to acquire, more people to meet, and more milestones to accomplish!</p>
